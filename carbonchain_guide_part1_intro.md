## SECTION 1: CARBON MARKETS FUNDAMENTALS

### 1.1 The Carbon Credit Concept

Carbon credits are tradable certificates or permits representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or the equivalent amount of other greenhouse gases (GHGs). The fundamental principle operates on a "cap and trade" mechanism:

- **Cap**: A regulatory body sets a limit (cap) on the total amount of GHGs that can be emitted by covered entities
- **Trade**: Entities that emit less than their allocated allowance can sell their surplus credits to those who exceed their limits

This market-based approach aims to:
1. Reduce GHG emissions cost-effectively by allowing flexibility in how and where reductions occur
2. Incentivize innovation in low-carbon technologies by creating financial value for emission reductions
3. Create price signals that reflect the environmental cost of carbon pollution

### 1.2 Types of Carbon Markets

#### 1.2.1 Compliance Markets (Regulated)
- Mandatory participation for specific sectors
- Examples:
  - European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)
  - California Cap-and-Trade Program
  - Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the northeastern United States
  - China's National ETS
  - South Korea's ETS

#### 1.2.2 Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM)
- Optional participation by organizations and individuals seeking to offset their emissions
- Driven by corporate social responsibility, ESG commitments, and consumer pressure
- Examples:
  - Gold Standard
  - Verified Carbon Standard (Verra)
  - American Carbon Registry
  - Climate Action Reserve

#### 1.2.3 Results-Based Carbon Finance
- Payments made for verified emission reductions
- Examples:
  - Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under Kyoto Protocol
  - REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation)
  - Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) by Japan

### 1.3 Carbon Credit Project Types

#### 1.3.1 Renewable Energy
- Solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal projects that displace fossil fuel-based energy

#### 1.3.2 Energy Efficiency
- Industrial process improvements, building efficiency upgrades, transportation efficiency

#### 1.3.3 Forestry and Land Use
- Afforestation/reforestation
- Avoided deforestation (REDD+)
- Improved forest management
- Agricultural land management (soil carbon sequestration)

#### 1.3.4 Methane Reduction
- Landfill gas capture
- Coal mine methane utilization
- Livestock manure management

#### 1.3.5 Industrial Gas Destruction
- Destruction of potent GHGs like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and nitrous oxide (N₂O)

### 1.4 Carbon Market Challenges

#### 1.4.1 Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)
- Establishing accurate baselines
- Measuring actual reductions
- Ensuring additionality (proving that reductions wouldn't have happened without the carbon market incentive)
- Preventing leakage (emissions shifting elsewhere)

#### 1.4.2 Market Inefficiencies
- Price volatility
- Limited liquidity
- High transaction costs
- Slow settlement processes (often weeks to months)

#### 1.4.3 Credibility and Transparency
- Ensuring environmental integrity
- Preventing double counting
- Maintaining comprehensive registries
- Addressing permanence concerns (especially for forestry projects)

#### 1.4.4 Fragmentation
- Multiple standards and methodologies
- Regional market isolation
- Lack of uniform pricing

## SECTION 2: INDIAN CARBON MARKET LANDSCAPE

### 2.1 Evolution of Carbon Markets in India

#### 2.1.1 Historical Context
- Initial engagement through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under Kyoto Protocol
  - India was the second-largest host of CDM projects globally
  - Over 1,600 registered projects (2005-2012 period)
  - Primary sectors: renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management

#### 2.1.2 Post-Kyoto Developments
- Shift to voluntary markets after decline in CDM
- India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under Paris Agreement:
  - Reduce emissions intensity of GDP by 45% from 2005 levels by 2030
  - Achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030
  - Create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent through forest and tree cover by 2030

### 2.2 Current Indian Carbon Market Mechanisms

#### 2.2.1 Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme
- Launched in 2012 under National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency
- Covers ~1,300 energy-intensive units across 13 sectors
- Mechanism:
  - Sets specific energy reduction targets for designated consumers
  - Overachievers earn Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts)
  - Underachievers must purchase ESCerts or pay penalty
- Trading occurs on power exchanges (IEX and PXIL)
- Completed 5 cycles to date with cumulative savings of ~92 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent

#### 2.2.2 Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Mechanism
- Established in 2010 to promote renewable energy generation
- Decouples physical electricity from environmental attributes
- One REC represents 1 MWh of renewable electricity
- Obligated entities must meet Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs)
- Trading on power exchanges with price bands set by regulatory authorities

#### 2.2.3 Coal Cess and National Clean Energy Fund
- Coal cess (tax) introduced in 2010 at ₹50/tonne, increased to ₹400/tonne by 2016
- Revenue directed to National Clean Energy Fund to finance clean energy initiatives
- Collected ~₹86,440 crores until integration with GST in 2017
