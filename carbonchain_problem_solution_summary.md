# CarbonChain: Problems and Solutions Summary

## 1. Core Problems in Current Carbon Markets

### 1.1 Inefficiencies in Indian Carbon Markets

| Problem | Current State | Impact |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Slow Settlement Cycles** | PAT scheme trading sessions happen quarterly with T+3 settlement; REC settlements take 7-10 days | • Projects wait months for payment<br>• Capital locked in pending transactions<br>• Limited trading opportunities<br>• Higher working capital requirements |
| **Price Opacity** | • No continuous price signals<br>• Trading only in specific windows<br>• Limited historical data access | • Difficult project valuation<br>• Price volatility between sessions<br>• Market manipulation risk<br>• Poor investment planning |
| **High Transaction Costs** | • Multiple intermediaries (5-7% fees)<br>• Complex documentation<br>• Legal review requirements<br>• Registry fees | • Small projects excluded<br>• Reduced market participation<br>• Lower returns for developers<br>• Inefficient capital allocation |
| **Verification Delays** | • Manual verification processes<br>• 30-60 days for review cycles<br>• Paper-based documentation<br>• Limited verifier capacity | • Delayed credit issuance<br>• High verification costs (12-18% of credit value)<br>• Limited project pipeline<br>• Outdated methodologies |
| **Limited Participation** | • Primarily large corporates<br>• Complex onboarding<br>• High minimum participation thresholds<br>• Technical knowledge barriers | • Illiquid markets<br>• Narrow market base<br>• Innovation constraints<br>• Exclusion of SMEs and retail |
| **Fragmented Markets** | • Separate PAT and REC mechanisms<br>• No integration between schemes<br>• Different methodologies across markets<br>• International vs. domestic silos | • Arbitrage inefficiencies<br>• Redundant verification<br>• Complex compliance management<br>• Reduced market depth |

### 1.2 Quantified Inefficiency Costs

The current market inefficiencies result in measurable economic losses:

- **Settlement Delays**: ₹700-900 crores annual opportunity cost from delayed capital deployment
- **Verification Costs**: ₹500-650 crores spent on manual verification processes annually
- **Limited Access**: Excludes potential 35-45 million tCO₂e from small/medium projects
- **Price Inefficiency**: 30-40% more price volatility than efficient markets, increasing hedging costs
- **Participation Barriers**: Only ~1,400 entities actively participating vs. potential 25,000+
- **Market Fragmentation**: 15-20% price differentials between comparable credits across markets

### 1.3 Current Trading Mechanisms in India

#### 1.3.1 PAT Scheme (ESCerts) Trading Process

1. **Issuance Mechanism**
   - Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) notifies targets for Designated Consumers (DCs)
   - At end of compliance period, DCs submit energy consumption reports
   - BEE reviews reports and calculates over/under achievement 
   - Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts) issued to overachievers via Registry
   - Each ESCert = 1 metric tonne of oil equivalent (mtoe) of energy savings

2. **Trading Framework**
   - Trading happens exclusively on Power Exchanges (IEX and PXIL)
   - BEE announces specific trading sessions (typically once per quarter) 
   - Each session lasts only 2-3 hours on designated days
   - Trading follows double-sided closed auction mechanism:
     * Buyers and sellers submit bids in 30-minute windows
     * Price discovery happens by matching highest buy with lowest sell bids
     * Single uniform market clearing price determined
   - Trading outside these sessions is not permitted
   - No secondary market or derivatives

3. **Settlement Process**
   - Exchange communicates successful trades to Registry
   - T+3 settlement cycle (trade confirmation takes 3 working days)
   - Registry updates ownership records after settlement
   - Payment clearance through exchange-designated banks
   - No direct P2P transfers allowed outside exchange

4. **Limitations**
   - Only designated consumers can participate
   - No price signals between trading sessions
   - Limited price discovery due to short trading windows
   - High minimum participation requirements
   - Delayed settlement finality
   - Lack of forward contracts or hedging mechanisms

#### 1.3.2 REC Trading Mechanism

1. **Issuance Process**
   - Renewable energy generators apply to State Nodal Agency
   - Central Agency (NLDC) validates generation data
   - Accredited generators receive 1 REC per MWh of clean electricity
   - RECs categorized as solar or non-solar
   - RECs credited to generator's Registry account

2. **Trading Structure**
   - Monthly trading sessions on last Wednesday at Power Exchanges
   - Trading window of only 2 hours (13:00-15:00)
   - Price bands determined by CERC (regulatory price floor and ceiling)
   - Trading follows similar auction mechanism as ESCerts
   - Forbiddance period: No transactions permitted 5 days before session
   - No continuous trading between monthly sessions

3. **Settlement Procedure**
   - Successful trades confirmed by exchange
   - Payment collected from buyers (T+1)
   - Funds transferred to sellers (T+3 to T+7)
   - Registry updated after confirmation
   - RECs extinguished upon use for RPO compliance

4. **Constraints**
   - Limited participant pool (mostly obligated entities)
   - Price band restrictions limiting true market dynamics
   - Illiquidity due to infrequent sessions
   - No secondary market trading
   - 1-3 year validity period creating expiration pressure
   - No forward markets or long-term procurement options

#### 1.3.3 Voluntary Carbon Market Trading

1. **Current Channels**
   - Primarily international registry-based (Verra, Gold Standard)
   - No dedicated Indian exchange for voluntary credits
   - Dominated by broker-based OTC transactions
   - International platforms (e.g., CBL, AirCarbon) host some Indian credits
   - Long negotiation periods (2-6 weeks typical)

2. **Pricing Mechanism**
   - Highly opaque, relationship-driven pricing
   - No standardized price discovery mechanism
   - Wide bid-ask spreads (often 40%+)
   - Limited price transparency and benchmarks
   - Significant information asymmetry between buyers and sellers

3. **Transaction Process**
   - Project developer lists with broker or direct to buyer
   - Extended negotiation period on price and volume
   - Legal review of contracts (1-3 weeks)
   - Custom purchase agreements for each deal
   - Manual registry transfers after payment confirmation
   - Settlement period of 1-2 weeks typical

4. **Barriers**
   - High intermediary fees (5-15%)
   - Legal costs for each transaction
   - Lack of standardized contracts
   - Minimum transaction sizes excluding smaller participants
   - No unified market or price signals
